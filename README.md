# Angular Spring Boot MySQL CRUD-Operation
This is a new series of CRUD operation with Java Full stack development. Here, I am using Spring boot and Angular.
If you are a beginner or new in Angular then definately, you should see this.

- There are two services:
  - Backend service
  - Fronted service
1. Backend Service:
    - Language: Java
    - Framework: Spring Boot
    - Database: MySQL
    - Repository: JPA

2. Fronend Service:
    - Angular

# How to get started
  - clone this repository.
  - run:
    ```npm i install```
  - It will download all required dependencies.
  - But before running angular application, first run backend application whihc will run on ```htpp://localhost:9000```
  - All endpoints are in backend application.
  - Run angular application on any port : ```42000```
